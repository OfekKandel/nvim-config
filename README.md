# Neovim Configuration Files
My personal configuration files for the terminal-based code editor [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) (based on Vim), written in Lua.  
General editor configuration is under `lua/config`. Plugin configurations are sorted by category under the `lua/plugins` directory (plugin manager is [Lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)).
